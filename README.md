# Data science portfolio by João Duro 

Hello! My name is João Duro and I'm a Junior Data Scientist at a consulting company in Lisbon, Portugal.
I made this page to share some of my projects. 

Here you will mostly see data science projects done in R, and hopefully some Python.

## Suicide Rates Shiny App (March 2019)

This is a **work in progress** aimed at developing my skills with R Shiny. It breaks down the number of suicides in each country by a number of different variables.

## Video Game Sales (October 2018)

My first Python project where I do some very basic data exploration and visualization, using pandas and matplotlib. We explore the sales of various games accross the years for different platforms and regions.
This is a very introductory data analysis.

## Toxic Comment Classification Challenge (April 2018)

Toxic Comment Classification Challenge by Jigsaw, was a Kaggle classification competition with the aim of classifying texts on their level of toxicity.
We were given a number of texts that you were meant to classify with displaying or not a sort of offensive content, like 'insult', 'identity hate', 'toxic', and others.

It was my first ever NLP project, and the goal was to get to know some of the packages used and how to approach this type of problem.
